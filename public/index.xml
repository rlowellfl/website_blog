      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Ryan Lowell, a Sr. Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. My particular area of focus is architecture, engineering, security, governance, and technical training on Azure. I truly enjoy helping companies build and expand their infrastructure in the Microsoft cloud.
During my nearly 20-year technology career I have worked across many areas of IT, including professional and managed services, security implementation, project delivery, technical training, system administration, and technical presales.
In my free time I&amp;rsquo;m a dad, husband, scuba diver, disc golfer, PC gamer, home automation enthusiast, and a perpetual tinkerer with arcane knowledge and forces best left alone.</description>

Utilizing this benefit can save considerable cost by eliminating the hourly licensing charges for Azure resources, allowing you to pay only for hardware resources. By leveraging Azure Hybrid Benefit, you can optimize your cloud infrastructure costs.</description>
