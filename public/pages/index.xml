      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Ryan Lowell, a Sr. Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. My particular area of focus is architecture, engineering, security, governance, and technical training on Azure. I truly enjoy helping companies build and expand their infrastructure in the Microsoft cloud.
During my nearly 20-year technology career I have worked across many areas of IT, including professional and managed services, security implementation, project delivery, technical training, system administration, and technical presales.
In my free time I&amp;rsquo;m a dad, husband, scuba diver, disc golfer, PC gamer, home automation enthusiast, and a perpetual tinkerer with arcane knowledge and forces best left alone.</description>
